It works in the peer to peer (p2p) method, seeds and peers are required for downloads to work. Because of this dependency, its speed tends to be the most inconsistent among all the options available on Hydra. However, it is still possible to achieve high speeds for games with a high number of seeds and peers.</p><p><code>Gofile</code>/<code>Pixeldrain</code>/<code>Datanodes</code>/<code>Mediafire</code>/<code>Qiwi</code> are free hosters that function with direct downloads, downloads made directly from servers without relying on seeds and peers. Because they are free, their speeds may still not be as fast and consistent. Among them, <code>Gofile</code> presents better and more consistent results.</p><p><code>Real-Debrid</code>/<code>Torbox</code> are paid debrid services, useful for downloading games faster and more consistently. Of both options, <code>Real-Debrid</code> is the best, although more expensive. You can check their prices on the official websites of <a href="https://real-debrid.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Real-Debrid</a> and <a href="https://torbox.app/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Torbox</a></p><p><code>Nimbus</code> is Hydra&#39;s own debrid service, which is still in beta, occasionally enabled for Hydra Cloud subscribers.</p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">All <code>downloaders</code>, except for <code>torrent</code>, will be compressed, as they work via direct download.</p></div><h2 id="dlcs-additional-content" tabindex="-1">DLCs/Additional Content <a class="header-anchor" href="#dlcs-additional-content" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;DLCs/Additional Content&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Usually, all sources distribute all additional content that games have.
