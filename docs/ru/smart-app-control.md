# How to disable `Smart App Controll`

`Smart App Controll` is an option of `Windows Defender` that blocks malicious files from executing on your system. However, it tends to flag crack files as mallicious. Therefore, sometimes you need to disable it to run a pirated game.

::: info Crack files are modified files to bypass the game's digital protection (DRM). Because of this, antiviruses can assign a generic virus identification to these files, even though they are not. This is called a `false positive`.

Here's a guide on how to disable it:

## Open the Start menu and search for `App & browser control`:
