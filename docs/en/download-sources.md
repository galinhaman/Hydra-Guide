# Download sources

There are several download sources created by the community. All known sources are gathered in the [Hydra Library](https://library.hydra.wiki/sources).

This topic will present and explain their main differences:

::: info Only sources with `Trusted` or `Safe to use` status will be covered. It is **highly recommended** that you only use sources with these statuses.
:::

## Formats

Different sources make their games available in different formats. Here is an explanation of each of them:

### Repack:

`Repack` is a term used for a **compressed** version of the game. Games from sources that make `repacks` available will come with an **installer** (setup.exe), which you need to run to install the game.

Download options of `DODI`, `FitGirl`, `GOG`, `KaOsKrew`, `Tiny-Repacks`, `Empress`, `ByXatab` (when **there is** `repack` or `GOG` in the title), `RuTracker` and `Wkeynhk` (when they **do not have** `[Portable]` in the title) will be `repacks`.

::: info After installing them, you can delete the installer files, to save storage.
:::

### Pre-installed:

`Pre-installed` is a term used for pre-installed games, only requiring their extraction.

Download options of `Online-Fix`, `SteamRip`, `AtopGames`, `Shisuy's source`, `SteamGG` and `Kazumi` (**not downloaded** through `torrent`) are `pre-installed` games.

::: info You must have [`WinRAR`](https://www.win-rar.com/fileadmin/winrar-versions/winrar/winrar-x64-711br.exe) installed on your computer to extract these files. (If Hydra did not already extract them automatically)
:::

### Portable:

`Portable` is a term used for `pre-installed` games, **without the need for extraction**.

Download options of `ByXatab` (when **there is not** `repack` or `GOG` in the title), `Kazumi` (**downloaded** via `torrent`), and `RuTracker` and `Wkeynhk` (when **there is** `[Portable]` in the title) are `portable` games, without the need for extraction.

## Available languages

Sizewise, for considerably small games, all sources will support all languages.

For bigger games, with multiple voiceovers, the sources may or may not support all languages:

- Download options of `ByXatab` in its [portable](download-sources.html#portable) versions, `DODI`, `FitGirl`, `GOG` and `Online-Fix` options, for the most part, support **all official languages** of the game.

- Download options of `ByXatab` in its [repacks](download-sources.html#repack), `SteamRip`, `AtopGames`, `Shisuy's source`, `SteamGG`, `KaOsKrew`, `Tiny-Repacks` and `Empress` only support **English and/or Russian**.

- Download options of `Kazumi`, `RuTracker` and `Wkeynhk` will vary depending on the download option.

::: info `RuTracker` and `Wkeynhk` will always display all available languages in the download option title.
:::

## Online

Download options of `Online-Fix` include a crack that enables online multiplayer via Steam, in most cases, and via Epic Games/Xbox, in certain cases.

Download options of `Wkeynhk`, that have `Pioneer` or `Canek77` in the title, will also come with a crack that enables multiplayer, similar to `Online-Fix`.

Download options from other sources, when they have `Coop`, `Multiplayer`, or `Online` in the title, will come with the `Online-Fix` crack pre-applied, or optionally, to enable online play.

If there are no download options that fit these definitions, it means there is no `Online-Fix` crack available to enable online play.

Some important information about online functionalities in these download options:
- Everyone must be on the same version of the game for online to work;
- In cases where online works via Steam (using 'Spacewar'), you can **only** play with people who are also playing with the `Online-Fix` crack. In cases where online works via Epic Games/Xbox, you can also play with people who own the original game;
- If the game has LAN (Local Area Network) multiplayer, you can play with anyone, using any source (even the original game), without relying on the `Online-Fix` crack. Everyone can just connect to the same local network using some program like [Radmin](https://www.radmin-vpn.com/) and play via LAN;
- If the game isn't updated, online play may not work properly.

## Downloaders

`Torrent` is the most common form of download among all sources. It works in the peer to peer (p2p) method, seeds and peers are required for downloads to work. Because of this dependency, its speed tends to be the most inconsistent among all the options available on Hydra. However, it is still possible to achieve high speeds for games with a high number of seeds and peers.

`Gofile`/`Pixeldrain`/`Datanodes`/`Mediafire`/`Vikingfile`/`Buzzheavier`/`Fuckingfast` are free hosters that function with direct downloads, downloads made directly from servers without relying on seeds and peers. Because they are free, their speeds may still not be as fast and consistent. Among them, `Gofile`, `Vikingfile` and `Buzzheavier` present better and more consistent results.

`Real-Debrid`/`Torbox` are paid debrid services, useful for downloading games faster and more consistently. Of both options, `Real-Debrid` is the best, although more expensive. You can check their prices on the official websites of [Real-Debrid](https://real-debrid.com/) and [Torbox](https://torbox.app/)

`Nimbus` is Hydra's own debrid service, which is still in beta, occasionally enabled for Hydra Cloud subscribers.

::: info All `downloaders`, except for `torrent`, will be compressed, as they work via direct download.
:::

## DLCs/Additional Content

Usually, all sources distribute all additional content that games have. Unfortunately, the only way to know exactly what content comes in each option is by checking the official website of each source.

::: info In games from the `GOG` source, the DLCs have their own setups. So, in addition to installing the base game, you need to install the DLCs, if you want.
:::

## Which sources should I use?

Based on all the points discussed in this topic, here are some recommendations of sources to use when downloading a game on Hydra Launcher:

### For offline games:

- `ByXatab`, in its [portable](download-sources.html#portable) options;
- `DODI`;
- `Kazumi`;
- `SteamRip`;
- `SteamGG`.

### For online games:
- `Online-Fix`;
- Any download option that has `Coop`, `Multiplayer` or `Online` in the title.

::: tip It is recommended to choose the most updated download option among these options.

Despite all their differences, and your personal preferences, it is recommended to add all sources with `Trusted` or `Safe to use` status. Some games are only available from a specific source.
